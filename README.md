This website wouldn't be possible without using Cody Cook's website as a guide. If you see something you like, please credit him. I would also love to hear any suggestions/improvements to the site!


All styles and documents can be found in the assets folder. The basic CSS skeleton comes from the  Bootstrap minimal style (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/). All other styles can be found in the custom.css file.
