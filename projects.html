                        Primary elections in the United States are widely believed to have a polarizing effect on elections. In particular, because primary elections tend to attract a loyal base of partisans, candidates are thought to take extreme positions in order to secure the party nomination. However, the political science literature contains surprisingly little empirical information on the evolution of candidate positions, largely due to poor data on the ideology of primary candidates. This paper addresses whether and how candidates strategically manipulate their ideological positioning in order to increase the chances of victory in the primary and general elections, as well as what factors and incentives account for these (or lack of) changes. Using congressional candidates' tweets from 2012 to 2018 to quantify the magnitude of differences in speech over the election cycle, I specify a multinomial model of speech and employ a bag-of-words approach to identify ideological rhetoric. My interest is in both documenting whether a shift in messaging occurs and exploring the nature and possible reasons for that shift. I will consider the effect of primary opponents' ideology, the divisiveness of the primary, and the general-election competitiveness of the district as well as the political ideology and favorability of party leaders.

                        Neuroeconomics research on value-based decision-making has generally relied upon assumptions regarding aspects of dopamine-connected brain regions as defining a “reward system” underlying utility. Recent studies of sensorimotor decision-making, however, suggest that reward processing extends well beyond the typically assumed anatomical and functional boundaries of this reward system. Instead, reward-dependent processing appears present throughout sensory systems, and representations of utility that are dissociable from other mechanisms such as attention have been identified in early sensory areas. This suggests that decision-making can act directly on sensory inputs rather than exclusively on associations that activate the reward system, but most neuroeconomic models do not account for this. It is unclear whether these findings apply directly to value-based decision-making, but recent findings show that consumer choice behavior can be predicted from visual evoked responses in the P2-N2 time window, which is thought to precede the categorization of visual stimuli and has been previously related to affective responses. We assess whether this early neural response, demonstrated previously to index consumer choice and is related to affective responses, is a precursor to similar affective valuation responses that neuroeconomic models commonly attribute to the dopamine-rich regions. We tested whether, like the affective nucleus accumbens response during value-based decision-making, evoked response differences reflect not just individual choice behavior but also generalize more readily across people than do individual choice responses, which has previously allowed researchers to forecast consumer market outcomes from the brain responses of individuals.

                        California’s recidivism rate is among the highest in the nation. Over 65% of individuals released from prison return within three years; 73% of recidivists commit a new crime within a year of release. Steady employment is one of the strongest predictors that a formerly incarcerated individual will maintain a distance from crime. Employment provides both a reliable source of income and a predictable daily routine. Unfortunately, the stigma associated with having a criminal record remains a significant barrier to employment across industries. The unemployment rate among the formerly incarcerated is 27% nationally, meaning over one in four of those once in prison are unable to find employment. Improving employment prospects for those with criminal records can be done through two mechanisms — increasing in-prison job training or incentivizing employers to hire those formerly incarcerated. We see numerous drawbacks to vocational job training programs. Instead, we propose a California-based version of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) targeted to employers hiring the formerly incarcerated. The Formerly Incarcerated Persons Opportunity Tax Credit (FIP-OTC) would scale by county factors, targeting tax credits to areas where economic opportunity for the formerly incarcerated is most dire.

                        We propose Raising Incentives for Student Education (RISE). This program, administered by the Department of Education (DoE), will provide all federally unemployed individuals, aged 18-24, with a voucher to attend participating community colleges in their state for free. To participate, community colleges will apply to receive a grant to cover the expense of enrolling these students and designing COVID-19 flexible learning infrastructure. 
                        RISE serves multiple goals: it will provide unemployed youth with increased education, decrease the labor force supply glut, train individuals for industries in which they would create the greatest value post-COVID-19, and provide an injection of funding into the community college system. The current economic crisis is the result of systemic issues in our nation. That is why RISE will attempt to address the root causes of the current instability rather than simply create a stop-gap measure to stabilize the country until the end of the pandemic.

                        The United States is once again facing the “Curse of Bigness." American industry has become increasingly consolidated, allowing private power to grow unfettered. With the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and the cloning of Snapchat’s distinctive features, Facebook has positioned itself as the monopolist of the social networking and digital advertising industries. This monopoly status grants Facebook tremendous power over the American people with no mechanism for accountability. Although Facebook does not set exploitative prices as the traditional monopolist does, its tepid commitment to the protection of user data privacy and its role in endangering the sanctity of American democracy has induced significant non-pecuniary negative externalities on the American people. Furthermore, its market dominance has suffocated innovation, leading to the establishments of kill zones for aspiring startups. Legislation seems ill-suited to redress the repercussions of Facebook’s monopoly status. Instead, the United States government must return to its great tradition of decentralized power and embrace robust antitrust enforcement.
